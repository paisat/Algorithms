 * The algorithm's complexity is O(1) for determining if a given move will win the game.
 * It cannot be O(1) in general since you need to know the state of the board to determine a winner. However, you can build that state incrementally such that you can determine whether a move wins in O(1).

 To start, have an array of numbers for each row, column, and diagonal for each player. On each move,
 increment the elements corresponding to the player for the row, column, and diagonal
 (the move may not necessarily be on a diagonal) influenced by that move.
 If the count for that player is equal to the dimension of the board, that player wins.
